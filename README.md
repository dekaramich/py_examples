# ex1.py
The script ex1.py creates an iterator class called Fibonacci with 3 functions
to iterate over the elements of the Fibonacci sequence.

# ex3.py 
The ex2.py script provides a function to sample a random date between two given dates. 
The function takes two date objects as input and returns a randomly sampled date between them.

# ex4.py
Mackey-Glass Time Series Modeling
The ex4.py script addresses the problem of modeling the dynamics of the Mackey-Glass chaotic time series. 
The goal is to develop a predictive model that captures the underlying patterns and dynamics within these time series. 
The script contains functions and classes to preprocess the data, train a predictive model, and evaluate its performance.
